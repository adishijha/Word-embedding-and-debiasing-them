# Word-embedding-and-debiasing-them

Natural Language processing

GloVe dataset (4 lakh words) is used which uses unsupervised learning to establish relation between words. 
Word analogy is performed by treating words as vectors. 
50 dimensional data is visualised in 2D.
Nearest neighbours of words are plotted.
Words which are biased in certain dimension are debiased.
